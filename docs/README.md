When using this in a 'desired-state' kind of way, renaming repositories is not supported. This has to do with the fact when you rename a repository, it will be considered a new repo and the old one will be deleted since its not in the list of 'desired repos' anymore.

Unfortunatly repos do not have an unique identifier that's returned by the Nexus API, therefore we can not use that to update a new of a repo.

## FAQ

Q: After enabling the Pro eatures, my playbook fails when configuring User Tokens or Cleanup Policies.
A: After enabling the pro features by uploading or installing the license, you have to reboot your Nexus instance first beore the additional API endpoints become available.

Take away: when not all attributes for PUT are passed through the API, the role might see it as changed, eventho its not.

if the order of the roles/privileges changes, it will not be updated, but it will try to PUT all the changes to the api

Q: I can not delete a blobstore BlobStore is in use and cannot be deleted
A: Make sure you have removed the blobstore from the all blobstore groups first
The order of the group_vars is important since the dictionaries will be passed through as-is to the Nexus API.
